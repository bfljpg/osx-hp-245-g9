# OpenCore ESP Backup for HP 245 G9 (6Q8M2ES)

I've installed macOS Monterey onto my laptop finally ~~but I wasn't able to fix some hardwares~~.

CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 5625U with its internal GPU

Drive: WD_BLACK SN770 2TB

Network: Realtek RTL8111 + Intel AX200

Audio: Realtek ALC236

# Here's the bugs

Almost all elements fixed ~~but randomly reboots while booting~~. I'm trying this ESP with new ACPI patches right now. It seems like sleep problem solved.
